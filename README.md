# ElevatorSagaSolution
I became fascinated with the Elevator Saga programming game, and decided to share the best solution I developed. It was able to beat all of the levels, though it wasn't optimized for number of moves, so beating those levels often required multiple restarts. Copy and paste this code into the editor box for the game.
